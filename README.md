# Tooltip customization in flutter chart

Flutter Cartesian chart widget provides support for customizing the tooltip in the chart using the callback events on rendering. Callback events are callback function or a method, which you pass as an argument into another function or method and can perform an action when you require it. Likewise, the chart widget provides a callback event called onTooltipRender to customize the tooltip contents as required.
